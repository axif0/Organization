## Organization files

Scribe provides language keyboards and interfaces that empower second language learners to communicate with confidence. This repository contains the Scribe branding files and serves as a base for discussing the organization itself. For discussions of our projects see the respective issues pages for [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android), [Scribe-Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) and [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Work that is in progress or could be implemented is tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/issues). Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing. Also note the use of the [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/labels/-priority-) label that indicates which issues are most important.
